A custom variant of the "Galaxy Library" WildStar mod designed for NexusForever.

# New Features
- Adds a `glprintitem` command to display the items you click on (as chat messages). This feature is off by default. Using this command toggles it.
- Adds a "Gimme!" button to the sidebar to run NexusForever's `!item add <id>` command on the last selected item.

# Potential Bugs
- I don't know if it's something on my end causing it or what, but there's a bug that causes a desync between your client and everyone else in the chat. After using the "Gimme" button on an item, the next message you send may display as the command itself (`!item add idhere`) instead of what you sent. __This only displays incorrectly for you.__ Everyone else will see the normal message as you typed it. It is unknown why this happens.
