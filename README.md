# GalaxyLibraryNFEdition
A custom variant of the "Galaxy Library" WildStar mod designed for NexusForever.

# New Features
- Adds a `glprintitem` command to display the items you click on (as chat messages). This feature is off by default. Using this command toggles it.
- Adds a "Gimme!" button to the sidebar to run NexusForever's `!item add <id>` command on the last selected item.
- Adds a "Wardrobe unlock" button, to directly unlock the selection for your holo-wardrobe (only on supported servers, like Omechron and WSRP)

# Potential Bugs
- Previous bug fixed: After using the "Gimme" button on an item, the next message you send may display as the command itself (`!item add idhere`) instead of what you sent. (Now uses /c instead of !)
